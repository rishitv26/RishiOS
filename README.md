# RishiOS

RishiOS is an OS designed for the personal satisfaction and learing of @rishitv26.

### Requirements:
* x86-64 architecture
* CPU and RAM only (no hardisks and other things)
* PS/2 Keyboard
* 1G Page support

## Usage:
The OS is designed around the Bochs emulator. To run the OS, install Boches emulator and click to "bochsrc.bxrc" file.
Building the project requires **NASM, GCC, and Linux Subsystem for Windows** (or just good old Debian).

The project can also run using qemu (look in scripts/qemu.sh)
### Simple Build
* install the following softwares mentioned above.
* run compile_run.sh in the scripts folder.
* if using windows, run windowsrun.bat (make sure WSL Debian is installed and all software is installed except for bochs which is on the windows machine.) 

## Suggestions for me?
I am new to the world of OS development, and would love any suggestions for better code, or just tips in general.

# RishiOS
RishiOS is another one of those OS's that you'll find on the internet, which are all made from hobby OS developers looking to invest time into.
What sepperates RishiOS from the rest is that it is a general graphical-user-interface OS that is actually intuitive to stare at when bieng looked upon 
by computer noobs.

## Installation
The OS is very lightwieght and simple for the most part, which makes it easy to be used on an emulator.
The repository already has build scripts for nerdy computer geeks who prefer to build the OS on thier own system with the source code.
If your just some random user trieng to find hacks for games or what not,

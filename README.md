# RishiOS

RishiOS is an OS designed for the personal satisfaction and learing of @rishitv26.

**NOTE**: keyboard interaction is done by PS/2 driver.

## Usage:
The OS is designed around the Bochs emulator. To run the OS, install Boches emulator and click to "bochsrc.bxrc" file.
Building the project requires NASM, GCC, and Linux Subsystem for Windows (or just good old Debian).

## Suggestions for me?
I am new to the world of OS development, and would love any suggestions for better code, or just tips in general.
